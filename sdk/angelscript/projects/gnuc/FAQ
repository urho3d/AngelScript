- Why do you have to specify PREFIX= even when building,
  when overriding the default ?

Because it allows easier linking. The way the Linux
link loader works, if the library name has a slash in it,
then it resolves it that way. If it doesn't it goes through
a series of steps which tries to find it. However, without
updating a certain file it won't find it under '/usr/local'
(and similar with '/tmp'). Therefore, as long as you have
the same PREFIX= (or don't specify it at all), all you need
to do to link to the shared version is link to it (and any
other dependencies; -lpthread comes to mind here). For
example the link options might be :
-langelscript_s -lpthread

- Why is it angelscript_s and not just angelscript
(like one might expect) ?

In the case you want to statically link (generally in
Linux it is preferred to use shared linking but there is
always an exception) you would have a problem with the
same name and path (name of library, two different
types: archive and shared object). Since some might
want to link statically and since Andreas told me that
is the recommended way, I opted for angelscript_s for
the shared object name.

CONTACT INFO:
If you have any questions or concerns, by all
means have Andreas contact me (at this time I
don't have an email I feel okay sharing - if it
seems this is of use to others I will likely
create an email on my server for this very
purpose). For now Andreas can forward the
message to me.
